Similar to previous year, there were startups who unexpectedly requested economic help, and not just a little amount of money either.

While our person kept trying to reinvent the wheel, their rival had quickly surpassed them in income. After the discussion, we took him out for a beverage and advised him to explore abroad for other strategies. However, he admitted that he had no contacts abroad and no idea where to start. As soon as we left the bar, our angels had already connected him with two titans of his field. However, business angels do not only provide contacts.
